title <b>Ugears Hurdy-Gurdy</b><br>
description <b>Introducing Hurdy-Gurdy, ugears newest creation that is completely different from all the previous models. It’s not a vehicle, or it is a nifty knickknack, or even a mini town. Hurdy-Gurdy is the actual string musical instrument: the world’s first wooden fully-functioning mechanical model that is all-in-one, a model for assembly, a puzzle, a toy and a completely functioning musical instrument. The idea of creating Hurdy-Gurdy takes us back to 16th century france, where this organistrum started its journey. This model is an exact replica of medieval french instrument, however unlike its original, ugears Hurdy-Gurdy features intricately detailed exquisite decor, that makes this model not only an instrument, but an esthetically pleasing work of fine craftsmanship.</b><br>

title <b>Ugears Mechanical Aquarium</b><br>
description <b>Have you ever been fascinated by the depths of the sea or ocean? have you ever dived and marveled at the underwater diversity and harmony? if you are one of such people, ugears offers you a change to bring these feelings to life by assembling our ‘Mechanical Aquarium’ model.This unique wooden puzzle features two fish chasing each other, as well as a tiny seahorse, observing the action from within algae fronds. The fish and the algae move parallel to each other but in different directions and with different speed, resembling the actual sea life rhythms.The idea of creating marine aquariums has been around for centuries, with the romans and the aztecs making the first recorded attempts. Maintaining the right conditions in such aquariums required frequently changing the water, so most of them were located near the sea or ocean shores. Creating the first ever balanced marine aquarium was credited to anna thynne, a renowned biologist, who managed to keep stony corals and seaweed alive in an aquarium in london for almost three years. This experiment of 1846 later inspired the creation of the world-famous london aquarium. As the years went by, technology came to aid the scientists and aquariums grew in complexity, featuring advanced lighting, aeration and filtration systems.Ugears lovers can now create their own mechanical aquarium without having to deal with all the above expenses and worries. All you need is our model and the desire to put it together!</b><br>

title <b>Ugears Aero Wall Clock</b><br>
description <b>Yes! Yes! Yes! Something so many ugears fans have been waiting for has finally made its appearance! We have lost count of how many times we got requests for an actual working wooden mechanical clock showing accurate time – and following all those requests our brightest engineering minds have delivered! It is with joy and pride that we present ugears aero clock to you. This unique mechanical clock with a weighted pendulum demonstrates the precision of the gears. Just assemble it, mount it on a wall, wind it up and enjoy the passing of time!Not only is it functional, but it also appeals to the fans of air travel. Back in 1783 the montgolfier brothers first successfully flew a hot air balloon, which marked the beginning of the new era for the whole of humanity. Just two years later the english channel saw its first hot air balloon crossing by an american john jeffries and his co-pilot Jean-Pierre blanchard. The world has achieved one of mankind’s fundamental dreams and it went far beyond mere amusement. It was the dawn of the new era of exploring the possibilities of flight, getting to know the power of winds and witnessing the majestic realm of the skies. As the seconds and minutes of the aero clock tick away, the intricate wooden balloon slowly rises up, only to descend when the hour strikes.Ugears steampunk aero clock also honors the clockmakers and horologists. One prominent figure was john harrison, whose clocks for ships were so accurate that they enabled the captains to at last determine their position at sea (by knowing the exact time in london and the time in their location, combined with the position of celestial bodies). Although the problem of discovering the vessel’s latitude had been solved as far back as 600 bc, it was the invention of the precise clock that finally did crack the problem of reliably establishing the longitude. It was for this that mr. Harrison was awarded with a hefty reward (the Parliament’s longitude act of 1714). Follow the footsteps of such great explorers and inventors by assembling this wonderful diy puzzle with your own hands!</b><br>

title <b>Ugears V-Express Steam Train With Tender</b><br>
description <b>V-Express steam train with tender is here to take you on a journey of innovations and technology.  Getting its inspiration from the victorian age of inventions, ugears created this fascinating steam locomotive model; an iconic symbol, commencing the beginning of global industrial transformation.The exquisitely detailed design of V-Express allows you to observe the beauty of moving elements. Shacks and gears, the flywheel and the cylinder-piston arrangement; all these features make ugears V-Express look like a real locomotive.Like all ugears mechanical transportation models, the V-Express is operated by a self-propelled motor, allowing the train to move on its own.  A single wind of the train engine produces enough power to run up to 13 feet.  The V-Express steam train operates on 3 settings: forward, back and idle.  The  “back” setting allows the train to roll backward and automatically hook up with the tender. The tender, though designed as a part of the V-Express steam train with tender model, is no less exciting and worth mentioning on an individual note. Designed based on the past century coal car, it is a fully functioning model, equipped with moving with elements like a locking hatch and dropping sides.</b><br>

Easier to control and manipulate, the helicopter has all the basic elements of a real aircraft: three-blade main and tail rotors, a cockpit with opening doors and a landing gear.The airplane module has a higher velocity and requires more skills to operate.  It’s designed is based on a prototype of wire-braced airplanes, with a 5-piston motor and may require a couple hours of flight training. Whichever wayward bird you choose to fly, the control tower is your cockpit and the main navigation device.  Its high-performance motor powers the swashplate, with the attached bar, that is used to connect the airplane on one side and has a balance weight on the other.  Get your flying helmet on…hold onto the wheel and get ready to become airborne!
