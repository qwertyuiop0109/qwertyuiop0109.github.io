The fish and the algae move parallel to each other but in different directions and with different speed, resembling the actual sea life rhythms.The idea of creating marine aquariums has been around for centuries, with the romans and the aztecs making the first recorded attempts. Maintaining the right conditions in such aquariums required frequently changing the water, so most of them were located near the sea or ocean shores. Creating the first ever balanced marine aquarium was credited to anna thynne, a renowned biologist, who managed to keep stony corals and seaweed alive in an aquarium in london for almost three years. This experiment of 1846 later inspired the creation of the world-famous london aquarium. As the years went by, technology came to aid the scientists and aquariums grew in complexity, featuring advanced lighting, aeration and filtration systems.Ugears lovers can now create their own mechanical aquarium without having to deal with all the above expenses and worries. All you need is our model and the desire to put it together!	https://ugearsmodels.us/catalog/ugears-mechanical-aquarium/	https://ugearsmodels.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01.-Mechanical-Aquarium-600x600.jpg	4820184121263	in stock	4820184121263	4820184121263	Ugears	Catalog

83.99 USD	Ugears Aero Wall Clock	Yes! Yes! Yes! Something so many ugears fans have been waiting for has finally made its appearance! We have lost count of how many times we got requests for an actual working wooden mechanical clock showing accurate time – and following all those requests our brightest engineering minds have delivered! It is with joy and pride that we present ugears aero clock to you. This unique mechanical clock with a weighted pendulum demonstrates the precision of the gears. Just assemble it, mount it on a wall, wind it up and enjoy the passing of time!Not only is it functional, but it also appeals to the fans of air travel. Back in 1783 the montgolfier brothers first successfully flew a hot air balloon, which marked the beginning of the new era for the whole of humanity. Just two years later the english channel saw its first hot air balloon crossing by an american john jeffries and his co-pilot Jean-Pierre blanchard. The world has achieved one of mankind’s fundamental dreams and it went far beyond mere amusement. It was the dawn of the new era of exploring the possibilities of flight, getting to know the power of winds and witnessing the majestic realm of the skies. As the seconds and minutes of the aero clock tick away, the intricate wooden balloon slowly rises up, only to descend when the hour strikes.Ugears steampunk aero clock also honors the clockmakers and horologists. One prominent figure was john harrison, whose clocks for ships were so accurate that they enabled the captains to at last determine their position at sea (by knowing the exact time in london and the time in their location, combined with the position of celestial bodies). Although the problem of discovering the vessel’s latitude had been solved as far back as 600 bc, it was the invention of the precise clock that finally did crack the problem of reliably establishing the longitude. It was for this that mr. Harrison was awarded with a hefty reward (the Parliament’s longitude act of 1714). Follow the footsteps of such great explorers and inventors by assembling this wonderful diy puzzle with your own hands!	https://ugearsmodels.us/catalog/ugears-aero-wall-clock/	https://ugearsmodels.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01.-Ugears-Aero-Clock-600x600.jpg	4820184121232	in stock	4820184121232	4820184121232	Ugears	Catalog
