GAStitle <b>Aero Wall Clock</b><br>
description <b>Yes! Yes! Yes! Something so many ugears fans have been waiting for has finally made its appearance! We have lost count of how many times we got requests for an actual working wooden mechanical clock showing accurate time – and following all those requests our brightest engineering minds have delivered! It is with joy and pride that we present ugears aero clock to you. This unique mechanical clock with a weighted pendulum demonstrates the precision of the gears. Just assemble it, mount it on a wall, wind it up and enjoy the passing of time!Not only is it functional, but it also appeals to the fans of air travel. Back in 1783 the montgolfier brothers first successfully flew a hot air balloon, which marked the beginning of the new era for the whole of humanity. Just two years later the english channel saw its first hot air balloon crossing by an american john jeffries and his co-pilot Jean-Pierre blanchard. The world has achieved one of mankind’s fundamental dreams and it went far beyond mere amusement. It was the dawn of the new era of exploring the possibilities of flight, getting to know the power of winds and witnessing the majestic realm of the skies. As the seconds and minutes of the aero clock tick away, the intricate wooden balloon slowly rises up, only to descend when the hour strikes.Ugears steampunk aero clock also honors the clockmakers and horologists. One prominent figure was john harrison, whose clocks for ships were so accurate that they enabled the captains to at last determine their position at sea (by knowing the exact time in london and the time in their location, combined with the position of celestial bodies). Although the problem of discovering the vessel’s latitude had been solved as far back as 600 bc, it was the invention of the precise clock that finally did crack the problem of reliably establishing the longitude. It was for this that mr. Harrison was awarded with a hefty reward (the Parliament’s longitude act of 1714). Follow the footsteps of such great explorers and inventors by assembling this wonderful diy puzzle with your own hands!</b><br>

GAStitle <b>Drift Cobra Racing Car</b><br>
description <b>Those of you who enjoyed ugears vehicles like the roadster, U9 grand prix and the dream cabriolet will surely appreciate the newest (and the toughest !) addition to our model car range : the drift cobra racing car ! This model plays tribute to shelby cobra 427, arguably the best car ever roaming the roads of this blue planet. Imagine a 7-liter 510 horsepower monster of an engine back in mid 1960s, accelerating to 60 mph in four seconds and boasting the top speed of 185 mph.This particular model was american Ford’s response to italian Ferrari’s dominance on the racing car scene. The shelby cobra 427, named after an automotive designer and former racing driver carroll shelby, lived up to the challenge and secured 4 consecutive wins at the world top 24-hour race event at le mans in 1966-1969. They were unbeatable and truly on fire ! 2019 movie ‘Ford vs Ferrari’, starring christian bale and matt damon, won an oscar for depicting this epic battle between rival racing teams. American muscle cars featured mighty V8 engines fitted to moderately lightweight chassis.Mass-produced, reasonably-priced and legal to use in the streets, muscle cars were notoriously famous for illegal street races and crashes. The excitement of gambling, however, was irresistible. Thus, on the days of the races the flat tires of the steel stallions were, again and again, burnt on the unforgiving asphalt. Bowing to the tradition and history, why not organize your own drag race with other model car lovers? this is a chance to shine that your drift cobra cannot miss! Unleash your beast of a vehicle on your unsuspecting friends’ cars, proving to them once and for all that the night is dark and full of Terrors…</b><br>

GAStitle <b>Sky Watcher Tourbillon Table Clock</b><br>
description <b>The theory of clockwork universe states that the whole world operates on the laws of mechanics. These principles – clear, pure, precise – are the foundation of the universe, as we know it. Such a theory greatly appeals to mechanical model lovers like ourselves, so we are proud to present yet another embodiment of our passion : the ‘Sky watcher tourbillon table Clock’ !Over the years, we’ve had numerous requests for creating a working wooden clock. Our aero clock, which is mounted on the wall and powered by gravity, is now being joined by this newest arrival, which uses the power of the spring to operate. Despite the challenges involved (gearing, friction, torsion, tooth strength), our engineers delivered a superior diy model, which is now yours for the taking! Now it is your turn to assemble your own state-of-the-art clock !The tourbillon – which is a central and eye-catching element of this model – is sometimes used to minimize the effects of gravity. In other models – including ours – it mostly serves as a decoration, elaborate and eye-pleasing! The sky watcher tourbillon is positioned on the top of the model and resembles a huge telescope, scanning the night sky for any unsolved mysteries out there !Abraham-Louis breguet constructed the prototype of the tourbillon in 1795. He was also able to make the mechanism much smaller, fitting it into a watch, which could be carried around in a pocket. Alfred helwig introduced the ‘flying tourbillon’ in 1920. His mechanism was mounted on one side, which meant it was easier to see its mechanical beauty. These days there are multiple variations of varying complexity, but the possibility to assemble one with your own hands must be exciting! Like in all ugears models, no glue or special tools are required – just pre-cut wooden pieces and a detailed color manual to guide you !</b><br>

The fish and the algae move parallel to each other but in different directions and with different speed, resembling the actual sea life rhythms.The idea of creating marine aquariums has been around for centuries, with the romans and the aztecs making the first recorded attempts. Maintaining the right conditions in such aquariums required frequently changing the water, so most of them were located near the sea or ocean shores. Creating the first ever balanced marine aquarium was credited to anna thynne, a renowned biologist, who managed to keep stony corals and seaweed alive in an aquarium in london for almost three years. This experiment of 1846 later inspired the creation of the world-famous london aquarium. As the years went by, technology came to aid the scientists and aquariums grew in complexity, featuring advanced lighting, aeration and filtration systems.Ugears lovers can now create their own mechanical aquarium without having to deal with all the above expenses and worries. All you need is our model and the desire to put it together!</b><br>

description <b>The horse mechanoid is ugears first mechanical walking quadruped.  Long before the electricity and steam-powered engines made a significant impact on society’s progress, horses were used as the main transportation and hauling source.  From very early on, in ancient greece, japan, and china, inventors inspired by the idea to enhance nature’s most impeccable design with endurance and durability of the mechanisms, attempted to build various walking machines.Combining the ingenuity of leonardo DaVinci’s inventions and innovative ideas of the modern world, in an attempt to reincarnate those walking machines, ugears created the horse mechanoid.  Like all ugears models, the mechanical horse was built to move on its own, powered by a genuine self-propelled mechanism.  However, there were challenges along the way of creating the mechanoid and bringing it to perfection.  While solving the problem of stability of moving construction, ugears toy engineers developed a new, revolutionary strategy.  Following the anatomical specifics of real horses, and to ensure that the Mechanoid’s legs move like the ones of a real horse, ugears designers implemented a claw mechanism.  Still, the moving element of the horse mechanoid  remains to be its rubber band mechanism, connected to the movable elements, in addition to a pendulum, located in Mechanoid’s chest.Escape from electronics and modern technologies and dive into the romantic, old-fashion fun of horse-back riding with ugears horse mechanoid.</b><br>

Shacks and gears, the flywheel and the cylinder-piston arrangement; all these features make ugears V-Express look like a real locomotive.Like all ugears mechanical transportation models, the V-Express is operated by a self-propelled motor, allowing the train to move on its own.  A single wind of the train engine produces enough power to run up to 13 feet.  The V-Express steam train operates on 3 settings: forward, back and idle.  The  “back” setting allows the train to roll backward and automatically hook up with the tender. The tender, though designed as a part of the V-Express steam train with tender model, is no less exciting and worth mentioning on an individual note. Designed based on the past century coal car, it is a fully functioning model, equipped with moving with elements like a locking hatch and dropping sides.</b><br>

The windmill tower is an exact replica of a cylindrical stowntower windmill, built right outside the village of charleston, warwick county, in 19623-33. Interesting to know, that this particular windmill was restored in 1974 and remains the earliest tower mill in england to retain its working parts.The model is powered up by a removable rubber-band motor, that activates the blades by the screw conveyor and the gear transmission. Once the motor is removed, the windmill will continue to work, allowing to observe the fine working mechanism in great details.Though based on 17th english classics, this model of post-medieval stone towers is spiced up with figurines of a famous duo of spanish literature: ingenious nobleman don quixote and his quirky companion sancho panza.</b><br>

It is a feature-packed reproduction of a vintage truck resembling the iconic 1920’s ford model. A set of rubber-bands powers a chattering four-cylinder engine with moving pistons as well as a capable of shifting into forward, neutral, park, and reverse transmission.  Inside the cabin is a working steering wheel and accelerator pedal that actually revs the engine. The UGM-11 truck is what we call a 100% “Rubberpunk”; it is a perfect combination of both, clockwork and steampunk worlds. We deliberately designed this model to have a raw, open look so even the casual observer could appreciate the marvels going on inside. This wooden truck kit may take some time to build, but the outcome is absolutely worth the effort for those who love mechanics.</b><br>

GAStitle <b>Stem Lab Curvimeter</b><br>
description <b>Whether you are planning a cross-country bike ride or a hiking trip with your mates, trying to measure your forest jogging route or simply curious about how a real distance-measuring tool works, the new ‘Curvimeter’ stem lab model from ugears will satisfy all of these urges!It comes in handy specifically when the lines which need to be measured are curved rather than straight (hence, the name) and a regular ruler is of no use. Before the birth of the internet and all the modern gadgets, it was the only reliable way to measure the distance on the map. You can feel the spirit of those times when you assemble your own curvimeter and put it to good use!Although the first person to patent the device was edward russel morris (in 1873), the issue of who the original invention belongs to is still viewed differently by various nations. Some attribute it to the prominent russian mathematician mykhailo lomonosov, others claim that zhāng héng of the chinese empire was the one. Certain sources suggest yet another locale – rome – and a much earlier date of 23 bc, when a certain virtuvius, an engineer by trade, mentioned a device greatly resembling its later versions.</b><br>

That night, however, only mary, joseph and a handful of wise men knew of what was about to happen. The magi traveled from afar to pay their respects to the mother and her child, sent to this world to make it better by the father himself. Although the exact details of how it happened are subject to a certain amount of interpretation, the significance of the moment cannot be disputed!Ugears celebrates the spirit of this occasion and all the virtues of the characters involved by recreating the nativity scene in this simple model. We purposefully created something which even the younger kids can assemble, for they are the ones who know the story as well as their mums and dads! Many of them have been in school nativity plays – and now they can assemble one themselves or together with their beloved parents!</b><br>
