83.99 USD	Ugears Tower Windmill	Ugears tower windmill is a fully functioning miniature replica of this world’s oldest mechanical invention. The earliest recorded reference of using the windmills goes back to the 1st century greece. However, ugears toy designers got their inspiration from an early 17th century england. The windmill tower is an exact replica of a cylindrical stowntower windmill, built right outside the village of charleston, warwick county, in 19623-33. Interesting to know, that this particular windmill was restored in 1974 and remains the earliest tower mill in england to retain its working parts.The model is powered up by a removable rubber-band motor, that activates the blades by the screw conveyor and the gear transmission. Once the motor is removed, the windmill will continue to work, allowing to observe the fine working mechanism in great details.Though based on 17th english classics, this model of post-medieval stone towers is spiced up with figurines of a famous duo of spanish literature: ingenious nobleman don quixote and his quirky companion sancho panza.	https://ugearsmodels.us/catalog/ugears-tower-windmill/	https://ugearsmodels.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/01.-Ugears-Tower-Windmill-600x600.jpg	4820184120846	in stock	4820184120846	4820184120846	Ugears	Catalog

57.99 USD	Ugears Mechanical Aquarium	Have you ever been fascinated by the depths of the sea or ocean? have you ever dived and marveled at the underwater diversity and harmony? if you are one of such people, ugears offers you a change to bring these feelings to life by assembling our ‘Mechanical Aquarium’ model.This unique wooden puzzle features two fish chasing each other, as well as a tiny seahorse, observing the action from within algae fronds. The fish and the algae move parallel to each other but in different directions and with different speed, resembling the actual sea life rhythms.The idea of creating marine aquariums has been around for centuries, with the romans and the aztecs making the first recorded attempts. Maintaining the right conditions in such aquariums required frequently changing the water, so most of them were located near the sea or ocean shores. Creating the first ever balanced marine aquarium was credited to anna thynne, a renowned biologist, who managed to keep stony corals and seaweed alive in an aquarium in london for almost three years. This experiment of 1846 later inspired the creation of the world-famous london aquarium. As the years went by, technology came to aid the scientists and aquariums grew in complexity, featuring advanced lighting, aeration and filtration systems.Ugears lovers can now create their own mechanical aquarium without having to deal with all the above expenses and worries. All you need is our model and the desire to put it together!	https://ugearsmodels.us/catalog/ugears-mechanical-aquarium/	https://ugearsmodels.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01.-Mechanical-Aquarium-600x600.jpg	4820184121263	in stock	4820184121263	4820184121263	Ugears	Catalog
