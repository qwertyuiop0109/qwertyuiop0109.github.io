403,95	567,93	83.99 USD	Ugears Tower Windmill	Ugears tower windmill is a fully functioning miniature replica of this world’s oldest mechanical invention. The earliest recorded reference of using the windmills goes back to the 1st century greece. However, ugears toy designers got their inspiration from an early 17th century england. The windmill tower is an exact replica of a cylindrical stowntower windmill, built right outside the village of charleston, warwick county, in 19623-33. Interesting to know, that this particular windmill was restored in 1974 and remains the earliest tower mill in england to retain its working parts.The model is powered up by a removable rubber-band motor, that activates the blades by the screw conveyor and the gear transmission. Once the motor is removed, the windmill will continue to work, allowing to observe the fine working mechanism in great details.Though based on 17th english classics, this model of post-medieval stone towers is spiced up with figurines of a famous duo of spanish literature: ingenious nobleman don quixote and his quirky companion sancho panza.	https://ugearsmodels.us/catalog/ugears-tower-windmill/	https://ugearsmodels.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/01.-Ugears-Tower-Windmill-600x600.jpg	4820184120846	in stock	4820184120846	4820184120846	Ugears	Catalog

638,05	803,02	57.99 USD	Ugears Mechanical Aquarium	Have you ever been fascinated by the depths of the sea or ocean? have you ever dived and marveled at the underwater diversity and harmony? if you are one of such people, ugears offers you a change to bring these feelings to life by assembling our ‘Mechanical Aquarium’ model.This unique wooden puzzle features two fish chasing each other, as well as a tiny seahorse, observing the action from within algae fronds. The fish and the algae move parallel to each other but in different directions and with different speed, resembling the actual sea life rhythms.The idea of creating marine aquariums has been around for centuries, with the romans and the aztecs making the first recorded attempts. Maintaining the right conditions in such aquariums required frequently changing the water, so most of them were located near the sea or ocean shores. Creating the first ever balanced marine aquarium was credited to anna thynne, a renowned biologist, who managed to keep stony corals and seaweed alive in an aquarium in london for almost three years. This experiment of 1846 later inspired the creation of the world-famous london aquarium. As the years went by, technology came to aid the scientists and aquariums grew in complexity, featuring advanced lighting, aeration and filtration systems.Ugears lovers can now create their own mechanical aquarium without having to deal with all the above expenses and worries. All you need is our model and the desire to put it together!	https://ugearsmodels.us/catalog/ugears-mechanical-aquarium/	https://ugearsmodels.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01.-Mechanical-Aquarium-600x600.jpg	4820184121263	in stock	4820184121263	4820184121263	Ugears	Catalog

The shelby cobra 427, named after an automotive designer and former racing driver carroll shelby, lived up to the challenge and secured 4 consecutive wins at the world top 24-hour race event at le mans in 1966-1969. They were unbeatable and truly on fire ! 2019 movie ‘Ford vs Ferrari’, starring christian bale and matt damon, won an oscar for depicting this epic battle between rival racing teams. American muscle cars featured mighty V8 engines fitted to moderately lightweight chassis.Mass-produced, reasonably-priced and legal to use in the streets, muscle cars were notoriously famous for illegal street races and crashes. The excitement of gambling, however, was irresistible. Thus, on the days of the races the flat tires of the steel stallions were, again and again, burnt on the unforgiving asphalt. Bowing to the tradition and history, why not organize your own drag race with other model car lovers? this is a chance to shine that your drift cobra cannot miss!

1 579,63	2 987,29	83.99 USD	Ugears Sky Watcher Tourbillon Table Clock	The theory of clockwork universe states that the whole world operates on the laws of mechanics. These principles – clear, pure, precise – are the foundation of the universe, as we know it. Such a theory greatly appeals to mechanical model lovers like ourselves, so we are proud to present yet another embodiment of our passion : the ‘Sky watcher tourbillon table Clock’ !Over the years, we’ve had numerous requests for creating a working wooden clock. Our aero clock, which is mounted on the wall and powered by gravity, is now being joined by this newest arrival, which uses the power of the spring to operate. Despite the challenges involved (gearing, friction, torsion, tooth strength), our engineers delivered a superior diy model, which is now yours for the taking! Now it is your turn to assemble your own state-of-the-art clock !The tourbillon – which is a central and eye-catching element of this model – is sometimes used to minimize the effects of gravity. In other models – including ours – it mostly serves as a decoration, elaborate and eye-pleasing! The sky watcher tourbillon is positioned on the top of the model and resembles a huge telescope, scanning the night sky for any unsolved mysteries out there !Abraham-Louis breguet constructed the prototype of the tourbillon in 1795. He was also able to make the mechanism much smaller, fitting it into a watch, which could be carried around in a pocket. Alfred helwig introduced the ‘flying tourbillon’ in 1920. His mechanism was mounted on one side, which meant it was easier to see its mechanical beauty. These days there are multiple variations of varying complexity, but the possibility to assemble one with your own hands must be exciting! Like in all ugears models, no glue or special tools are required – just pre-cut wooden pieces and a detailed color manual to guide you !	https://ugearsmodels.us/catalog/ugears-sky-watcher-tourbillon-table-clock/	https://ugearsmodels.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sky-Watcher-Tourbillon-Table-Clock-01.jpg	4820184121324	in stock	4820184121324	4820184121324	Ugears	Catalog
3 119,61	3 823,52	83.99 USD	Ugears Aero Wall Clock	Yes! Yes! Yes! Something so many ugears fans have been waiting for has finally made its appearance! We have lost count of how many times we got requests for an actual working wooden mechanical clock showing accurate time – and following all those requests our brightest engineering minds have delivered! It is with joy and pride that we present ugears aero clock to you. This unique mechanical clock with a weighted pendulum demonstrates the precision of the gears. Just assemble it, mount it on a wall, wind it up and enjoy the passing of time!Not only is it functional, but it also appeals to the fans of air travel. Back in 1783 the montgolfier brothers first successfully flew a hot air balloon, which marked the beginning of the new era for the whole of humanity. Just two years later the english channel saw its first hot air balloon crossing by an american john jeffries and his co-pilot Jean-Pierre blanchard. The world has achieved one of mankind’s fundamental dreams and it went far beyond mere amusement. It was the dawn of the new era of exploring the possibilities of flight, getting to know the power of winds and witnessing the majestic realm of the skies. As the seconds and minutes of the aero clock tick away, the intricate wooden balloon slowly rises up, only to descend when the hour strikes.Ugears steampunk aero clock also honors the clockmakers and horologists. One prominent figure was john harrison, whose clocks for ships were so accurate that they enabled the captains to at last determine their position at sea (by knowing the exact time in london and the time in their location, combined with the position of celestial bodies). Although the problem of discovering the vessel’s latitude had been solved as far back as 600 bc, it was the invention of the precise clock that finally did crack the problem of reliably establishing the longitude. It was for this that mr. Harrison was awarded with a hefty reward (the Parliament’s longitude act of 1714). Follow the footsteps of such great explorers and inventors by assembling this wonderful diy puzzle with your own hands!	https://ugearsmodels.us/catalog/ugears-aero-wall-clock/	https://ugearsmodels.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01.-Ugears-Aero-Clock-600x600.jpg	4820184121232	in stock	4820184121232	4820184121232	Ugears	Catalog
